// Episode 9

let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

if (murderer === 'Professor Plum') {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

//Returned expected: 'The murderer is Professor Plum'
//Reason: The global variable didn't chance because both instances
//are treated as different variables since they have different scopes.
