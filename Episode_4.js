// Scope Homework: Who Dunnit
// Learning Objectives
// Understand function scope
// Know the difference in between the let and const keywords
// Brief
// Using your knowledge about scope and variable declarations in JavaScript, look at the following code snippets and predict what the output or error will be and why. Copy the following episodes into a JavaScript file and add comments under each one detailing the reason for your predicted output.
// Episode 4

let suspectOne = 'Miss Scarlet';
let suspectTwo = 'Professor Plum';
let suspectThree = 'Mrs. Peacock';

const declareAllSuspects = function() {
  let suspectThree = 'Colonel Mustard';
  return `The suspects are ${suspectOne}, ${suspectTwo}, ${suspectThree}.`;
}

const suspects = declareAllSuspects();
console.log(suspects);
console.log(`Suspect three is ${suspectThree}.`);

// Return expected:
//The suspects are Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel Mustard.
//reason: suspectThree has a different scope - local variable inside of the function.
// Suspect three is Mrs. Peacock.
//reason: Will print Mr. Peacock beacuse the variable has globa scope.
